### Mid Marks Dataset

#### Project Overview
The Mid Marks project analyzes mid-term exam scores of students from different sections. This dataset helps in evaluating student performance across various subjects and identifying trends in academic achievement.

#### Dataset Description
The dataset represents mid-term exam marks of students from different sections. It contains 718 records with student marks across various subjects.

##### Dataset Overview:
- **Total Records:** 718
- **Total Columns:** 8

##### Key Attributes and Their Descriptions:
- **S.NO** – Serial number of the student (some values appear to be missing at the end).
- **SECTION** – The section (group) to which the student belongs (e.g., ALPHA, ZETA).
- **DV** – Marks obtained in Digital VLSI.
- **M-II** – Marks obtained in Mathematics-II.
- **PP** – Marks obtained in Physics Practical.
- **BEEE** – Marks obtained in Basic Electrical & Electronics Engineering.
- **FL** – Marks obtained in Foreign Language.
- **FIMS** – Marks obtained in Fundamentals of Information & Management Science.

#### Observations:
- Some **S.NO** values are missing towards the end, meaning student IDs might not be recorded properly for all rows.
- The dataset includes students from multiple sections, allowing for section-wise performance analysis.
- Marks vary across subjects, indicating different difficulty levels or student performance trends.
- Some students have very low scores (e.g., **M-II = 0** for some students), which might indicate absent students or poor performance in certain subjects.

#### Usage
This dataset can be used for:
- Analyzing student performance trends across different subjects and sections.
- Conducting statistical analysis on student scores.
- Identifying students at risk based on low scores.
